In this laboratory work we've studied the GDI Primitives and Bezier Curves. We have worked with mouse and keyboard. We have developed an app which draws 5 lines, 2 bezier curves, 4 plane objects. With 2 filled objects with gradient, make different actions on keyboard interactions, made possible to draw with mouse and even made the possibility to use the mouse as an eraser.
